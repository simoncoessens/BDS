## Introduction

Recommendation systems play a crucial role in many modern applications, with around 80% of Netflix viewing hours driven by recommendations. While graphs have proven successful in enhancing recommendation systems, utilizing graph data effectively is challenging due to the complexity of graph structures. This project explores various knowledge graph embedding techniques to transform graph data into a format that can be used to build effective recommender systems.

## eBISS 2024

This project was presented at the Twelfth European Business Intelligence & Big Data Summer School (eBISS 2024), which took place from July 1 to July 5, 2024.

eBISS 2024 featured formal sessions on key topics in business intelligence and big data, as well as special sessions for participants to present their own research. Our project was showcased in one of these poster sessions, where we had the opportunity to share our findings on using knowledge graph embeddings for recommendation systems.
